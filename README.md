# Face-Mask-Detection-using-CNN
This project focuses on developing an intelligent system that can detect whether a person is wearing a face mask using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system is designed to aid in public health measures by ensuring compliance with mask-wearing protocols, particularly in high-risk or crowded areas.
